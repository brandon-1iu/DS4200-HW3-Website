                <h2>Why I Love Data Science & Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    Data Science and Technology have been central to my academic and professional journey. It all started with my interest in using 
                    technology to solve real-world problems, which led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Data Science & FinTech at Northeastern University. 
                    My passion has only grown stronger through various practical experiences and projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I find most captivating about this field is the way it combines analytical thinking with practical problem-solving. 
                    This unique combination creates opportunities for innovation in areas like financial technology and business intelligence. 
                    I've had the chance to work on exciting projects like the Boston Crime Incident Analysis Project, where I analyzed over 1,000 
                    crime incidents using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to identify trends and risk factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I've developed my skills through various internships and projects. I've worked as a Data Analyst & Management 
                    Intern at CATRC Limitada and as a Data Analyst & Project Coordinator Intern at JCM New Power Group. These experiences have not only 
                    improved my technical abilities but have also taught me the importance of cross-cultural communication and project coordination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue exploring the intersection of data science, finance, and technology. I believe that these 
                    fields will play a crucial role in shaping the future of business and technology, and I look forward to being part of this transformation.
                </p>
