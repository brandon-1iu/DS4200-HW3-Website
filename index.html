                    Hello! My name is Brandon Liu, and this is my personal website. I'm currently a student studying Data Science and FinTech at Northeastern University. 
                    I created this website as part of my journey to learn more about web development and to share my interests with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always been fascinated by using technology to solve financial and business challenges, which led me to pursue my current studies. My academic 
                    journey has been enriched by experiences at Northeastern's campuses in London, Bay Area, and Boston, which have shaped my global perspective and 
                    strengthened my passion for this field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, soccer, and architecture. These interests help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and provide me with opportunities 
                    to explore different cultures and perspectives. I believe that a well-rounded approach to life is essential for personal growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, I hope to apply my skills in data analysis, financial innovation, and international business to make meaningful contributions to the 
                    industry. I'm particularly interested in roles such as Business Analyst, Technical Consultant, Data Science Intern, Data Analyst, and Business 
                    Intelligence Analyst. I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and am committed to continuing my learning journey.
